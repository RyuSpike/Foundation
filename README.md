# Foundation
The following is a brief description of what this project is about.
The project foundation is just  a tool used to keeep track of four
different types of foundations that contribute towards one of the eight UN Millenium development goals.
The goal being to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.
The four foundations in this case are a Feeding scheme, an orphanage, an Old Age home and an Educational foundation.
A description of how they each contribute to that goal is as follows:
Feeding scheme - this contributes to ending extreme hunger by giving free food to the homeless and chldren 
from previously disadvantaged schools.
Orphanage - This places takes take of children that are not able to take care of themselves by offering food, shelter and sometimes
education which are all neccessary for combating poverty and hunger.
Old Age home - The same as an orphanage but just food and shelter and money since some of the eldrly would be somewhat
able to do somethings themselves they need money i.e an allowance thus contributong to ending poverty and hunger.
Educational Fundation - This is a key aspect for this goal because the better educated the people in a society are the 
more likely that society is gon to suceed in eradicating poverty which in turn will eradicate hunger.
